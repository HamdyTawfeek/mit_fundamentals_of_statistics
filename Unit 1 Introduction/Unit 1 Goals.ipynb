    "* Give introduction to statistics and probability and the relation between them\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recall the statements of the (strong/weak) law of large numbers and the central limit theorem and know to apply these for large sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply Hoeffding's inequality to the sample means of bounded i.i.d. random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recall the probability density function and properties of the Gaussian distribution .\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Gaussian probability tables to obtain probabilities and quantiles .\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distinguish between convergence almost surely , convergence in probability and convergence in distribution , understand that these notions are from strongest to weakest.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine convergence of sums and products of sequences that converge almost surely or in probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply Slutsky's theorem to the sum and product of a sequence that converges in distribution and and another that converges in probability to a constant.\n",
