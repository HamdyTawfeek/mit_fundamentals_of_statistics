    "\n",
    "* Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning and AI are all data driven fields with shared principles: gather data, process data, get insight and ultimately make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Statistics is a set of techniques at the core of data processing. As we're moving towards bigger data sets, computational aspects come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most machine learning methods are descriped as an algorithm, but usually what this algoithm does is implement some statistical principle in an efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The statistical view is that data comes from a random process. and they're actually\n",
    "representative of this random process. If we had infinite computational power and infinite data, we could describe the random process completely accurately. However there would be still be some inheret randomness due to aspects of data we don't know or understand.\n",
    "The goal of statistics is to extrapolate from a finite number of data to what\n",
    "you would get if you had an infinite amount of observations.\n",
    "And then once you know this, you know you're going to be able to make the most accurate predictions.\n",
